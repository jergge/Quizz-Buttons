# Quizz-Buttons

An Arduino app

Creating a gameshow-like experiance with buttons to press when answering questions

### Why?
My family likes to do newspaper quizzes, like heaps (we'll even save them up for when we can get together). But agreeing on a system of answering the questions in a way that's both fair and competitive is hard...  
- Do we each yell out the answer?  
- Do we yell our names first and wait to be called on?  
- Can we have a second guess before everyone gets a first?  

I'm sure you can imagine how stressful this is for everyone, so I thought the solution would be to wire up some buttons and LEDs, wrap them together with a bit of code and create the solution!

### How to use the hardware
Documentation not ready, as the system is still being worked on


### My Issues
Having not done much programming for small systems before, and also coming primarally from langauages that abstract away most of the memory management (and run on systems that have GIGABYTES of RAM) such as PHP and C# - I'm aware that I have not done a great job of optimising the code for a microcontroller.  
- Creating TONS of objects and holding them all in memory
- Over-optimising and probobly over abstracting things for what is, in the end, very specific code for niche hardware that I am building

Having said that, it's better to get something running and be able to optimise it later.
